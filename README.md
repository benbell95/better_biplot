# Ben's better biplot!

A script to create beautiful looking biplots using base R, without the need to use or install any additional packages. Designed to work with prcomp() and princomp() output for principal component analysis (pca), but can also work with any other data. The function is compatible with the base biplot() function, but offers significant enhancements (new features) and full customisation of the biplot.
